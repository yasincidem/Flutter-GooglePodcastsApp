        "description": "<p> </p>\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\">In this episode of the <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/podcast\"><i>Voices from DARPA</i></a> podcast, <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/staff/dr-tom-rondeau\">Tom Rondeau</a>, a program manager since 2016 — first in the agency’s <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/offices/mto\">Microsystems Technology Office</a> before switching over this year to the <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/offices/sto\">Strategic Technology Office</a><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"> </span>— takes listeners on a kaleidoscopic tour of his efforts to usher wireless technology into a new era. Anchored in an emerging technology arena known as software-defined radio (SDR), his programs dive deeply into the pathbreaking hardware, software, computational techniques, power efficiencies, and innovation communities that it will take to do more with the electromagnetic spectrum than ever before. Think of every cellphone call ever made, of satellite communication, and now of billions of devices communicating wirelessly via apps and the internet. And now think beyond all of that. The tattoos of Maxwell’s Equations — which famously capture the behavior of electromagnetic waves as discerned by the 19<sup>th</sup> century physicist James Clerk Maxwell — on Tom’s forearms reveal just how devoted he is to his technology-development mission. “I look down at those every day and have a moment of awe about what we have been able to do,” he tells listeners. And then he has another moment of awe as he imagines how much more he might be able to pull off as a DARPA program manager.<o:p></o:p></p>\n<p> </p>",

We discuss a recent article about the effects of communicating uncertainty on people's trust in scientific findings and scientists. When should and shouldn't scientists communicate uncertainty, and how should they do it? How should scientists prioritize keeping people's trust versus being up front about what they don't know? What are the different sources of uncertainty in scientific knowledge, and how should scientists deal with all of them? Plus, we get a followup letter from someone who asked about career support for a nonacademic partner - and they share what they learned and how things worked out.</p>\n<p>Link:</p>\n<ul><li><a href='https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/117/14/7672.full.pdf'>The effects of communicating uncertainty on public trust in facts and numbers</a>, by Anne Marthe van der Bles et al.</li>\n</ul><p>The Black Goat is hosted by Sanjay Srivastava, Alexa Tullett, and Simine Vazire.

        "description": "<br />\nFour hundred years ago, Galileo Galilei knelt before a group of Cardinals of the Catholic Church and was forced to recant his heretical belief that the Earth revolves around the sun.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&#8220;This must have been horrific for him,&#8221; says Dr. Mario Livio, author of a new biography titled <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cqVswC\">Galileo and the Science Deniers.</a> &#8220;To basically disavow everything he strongly believed in as a scientist.&#8221;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThis week on the show, we talk with Dr. Livio about Galileo&#8217;s life and struggles, and what his experience can teach us about the science deniers living in our own time.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Galileo-Science-Deniers-Mario-Livio/dp/1501194739/ref=as_li_ss_il?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1589421573&amp;sr=8-2&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=heph04-20&amp;linkId=1647586908176a2fd5d41868608ab407&amp;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nFinding the Center<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nGalileo was an Italian astronomer, physicist, and polymath who lived and studied in Italy around the turn of the seventeenth century.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nHe may be best known for an experiment that he probably didn&#8217;t actually do &#8211; the apocryphal tale of Galileo dropping different objects off the side of the Leaning Tower of Pisa to see how they would accelerate.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBut Galileo&#8217;s astronomical observations, and the conflict they produced, take center stage in Dr. Livio&#8217;s new book. It&#8217;s a story that surprisingly few people have heard.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&#8220;Galileo is one of the most fascinating personalities in history. While everybody has heard about Galileo, I discovered that very few people actually know exactly what happened to him,&#8221; Livio recalls.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDr. Mario Livio, author of Galileo and the Science Deniers<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe book begins as a straightforward biography, describing Galileo&#8217;s early years, studying and teaching at Universities around Italy. But as the chapters progress, the reader begins to pick up on the faint but steady drumbeat of Galileo&#8217;s impending battle.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDr. Livio sets the stage: &#8220;Aristotle and Ptolemy had a geocentric model of the solar system, in which the Earth was at the center and everything else revolved around the Earth. And the Catholic Church, over the years, adopted this particular model as its orthodoxy.&#8221;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&#8220;Copernicus changed that by suggesting that the sun is actually at the center, and the Earth and all the other planets revolve around the sun.  And that&#8217;s where Galileo enters the scene.&#8221;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe book describes Galileo&#8217;s astronomical observations that built a case for the heliocentric model of Copernicus. The reader gets to follow along on this path of discovery, observing Galileo as he observes the Phases of Venus, or spots circling the sun, and draws new conclusions about the position of our planet in the solar system.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe Road to Rome<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBut inevitably, Galileo&#8217;s research and writings come to the attention of the Church, and his trajectory is locked on a path toward conflict with Pope Urban VIII.  <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThrough a series of Papal threats, legal injunctions, and a three-phase trial that reads like the script of an episode of Law &amp; Order, Galileo is found &#8220;vehemently suspect of heresy&#8221; for asserting that the Earth revolves around the sun.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nHe must choose between recanting these views or being labeled a heretic &#8211; a title that would lead to his torture and death. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nNearing seventy years of age,",

        "description": "<p>Peer review is a major part of how science works today. In this episode we talk about how we approach doing peer reviews. How do you distinguish between differences in approach or preference - \"I would have done it a different way\" - versus things that you should treat as objections? How much weight do you put on different considerations - the importance of the research question, the novelty, the theory, the methods, the results, and other factors? What's your actual process - do you read front-to-back, or jump around? How much do you edit and wordsmith your reviews? When there are appendices, supplements, open code and materials, and preregistrations, which things do you read and how do you factor them in? How do you think about your potential biases and how to mitigate them? Plus: We answer a letter about deciding whether to pursue a postdoc versus other options.</p>\n<p>The Black Goat is hosted by Sanjay Srivastava, Alexa Tullett, and Simine Vazire.

        "description": "<br />\nIt&#8217;s that time again &#8211; the virtual mail bag is overflowing, so we invited Susanna Harris of <a href=\"http://phdbalance.com\">PhDBalance.com</a> to help us answer YOUR emails, Tweets, and messages.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBringing the Heat<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWe start with a few burning questions about applications and interviews.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe first question comes from a listener who was promised a strong letter of recommendation by research PI, but when the application period rolled around, the PI was &#8216;too busy&#8217; to write the letter.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWhat should I do when I can&#8217;t get ahold of the PI? Maybe he is purposely ghosting me&#8230; How do I explain this situation without sounding like I am bad mouthing the PI if I get asked about this? Please help.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSusanna, Josh, and Daniel spend some time describing why those letters of recommendation are so important, and lay out plans A, B, and C for what to do when the PI just won&#8217;t deliver.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nNext, we hear from a listener who is embarking on her first interviews, and wants to know what to wear!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;I have received my first interview invitations for biomedical umbrella programs and I realize I don&#8217;t know what I should wear to these events. I realize some of the activities during an interview weekend are more informal, but how formally should I be dressed for the faculty interviews?<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe answer is not quite as cut-and-dried as you may think &#8211; different universities, even within a single city, can have different expectations.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWe talk about what you should definitely NOT wear, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B7q5KAJp1PF/\">offer some guidelines</a> on how to look professional while still feeling comfortable.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nFinally, we hear from a student who suffered a major setback.  Due to a traumatic event, she had to leave school for a period of time, and failed several classes in the process.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nFortunately, she&#8217;s recovering and back to finish her senior year. But she&#8217;s concerned that the low grades and gap in her transcript will prevent her from going to graduate school. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMoreover, she doesn&#8217;t know how to talk about this event that so challenged her life.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMy main question is how do you frame personal and difficult life experiences when asked about them in interviews, applications, etc? I know that I am driven, tenacious, and ready to pursue a graduate degree but unsure how to frame my past experience to my advantage. I am also unsure of how to anticipate others&#8217; reactions if I do speak candidly. I know that I have an empowering story but am finding it hard to balance oversharing and not being detailed enough. I don&#8217;t want to seem like I am flaky or give up when facing a challenge, which is how it currently appears on my transcript. I would be interested in hearing from graduate students with similar experiences of taking a mental health break from university life and later returning.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWe answer those questions, and more, this week on the show.  In fact, we had SO many listener questions this week, we&#8217;ll be back next time with more of your inquiries and more Susanna Harris!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTo hear more from Susanna, check out these epsiodes:<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://hellophd.com/2019/02/110-the-secret-life-of-pets-in-grad-school/\">110: The Secret Life of Pets (in Grad School)</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://hellophd.com/2018/09/100-the-one-where-we-celebrate/\">100: The One Where We Celebrate</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://hellophd.com/2018/05/093-grad-school-mental-health-crisis-what-you-can-do/\">093...",

        "description": "<p>This week we present two stories about the sounds that silence can take on.</p><p><strong>Part 1: </strong>Kambri Crews attempts to smuggle a gift into prison for her father, who is deaf.<strong></p><p></strong></p><p><strong>Part 2: </strong>As Kristine Lycke enters kindergarten, her mother starts treatment for a mysterious illness.<strong></p><p></strong><em>Kambri Crews once lived with her deaf parents in a tin shed in Montgomery, Texas. She now owns and operates the performance venue Q.E.D. in Astoria, Queens. Kambri is also a renowned storyteller and the author of the critically acclaimed and New York Times best selling memoir Burn Down the Ground (Random House). She has performed on The Moth (MainStage &amp; radio), Women of Letters, Risk! and Mortified. In 2014, Kambri opened QED, a performance venue meets community and learning center. With over 100 events per month ranging from comedy, storytelling and music to classes like embroidery, cartooning and writing, there is something for everyone. Since its opening, QED has been featured on The Jim Gaffigan Show, NY1, The New York and LA Times and countless other media outlets. Performers have included the super famous like Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon, Janeane Garofalo, to the first-time performer and everyone in between. Also a public speaker, Kambri has given speeches for Girls, Inc., University of Texas, Texas Book Festival, University of Oregon, SXSW (South by Southwest), DeafHope, and many other schools, colleges, book festivals, and events.</em><strong></p><p></strong></p><p><em>Kristine Lycke is a Daughter, Mother, Survivor, Warrior. She holds an Honors B.S. Degree in Applied Psychology from Farmingdale State College, which she received – along with the 2017 SUNY Chancellor’s Award for Student Excellence- just 3 years after completing treatment for Stage III Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (breast cancer). Cancer has always been a part of Kristine’s life, having lost her mother to the disease when she was only 8 years old. Wanting to give back to the facility that saved her life, Kristine works as a Patient Care Coordinator at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. When she is not working, Kristine enjoys spending time with her wife and learning far more about My Little Pony than she ever thought possible from their 6 year old daughter.</p><p></em></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

        "description": "<p>This week we present two stories that give us insight into the birth and life of a scientist.</p><p><strong>Part 1: </strong>As a 16-year-old, Lily Be gets an unexpected education on the reproductive system.</p><p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Xavier Jordan discovers the party side of science at his first scientific conference.</p><p><em>Lily Be started sharing stories in Chicago by accident in 2010. She never had a want to express herself artistically. This is not something she ever planned on doing. Lily is from the westside of Chicago, born and raised where she's spent most of her days raising her son. Storytelling fell into her lap one day and she's gone on to do crazy amazing wonderful things with it. From winning story competitions that would inspire and oftentimes usher more Latinos and marginalized people to tell their stories, to teaching people from all walks of life to share theirs, Lily has not stopped giving back to the artform that changed and saved her life. Lily produces The Stoop and Story Collider, is an editorial assistant for Story News magazine, and account manager for GoLucky Studios. She teaches storytelling all over the city both in person and online, is writing a book, and hosting a myriad of community and storytelling events. She's half magic, half amazing, and 100% real. </em></p><p><em>Xavier Jordan is a University of Illinois graduate in chemistry and molecular and cellular biology. He is currently applying for microbiology research positions in Chicago. He's been telling stories for a long time and is glad to be part of the scene again.</em></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.
